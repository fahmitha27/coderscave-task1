Excited to share my project completed during my internship at CodersCave.

Project Description: The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior in an e-commerce setting. The dataset consists of 350 customer records, with information on various attributes that are essential for understanding and predicting customer behavior. This analysis aims to provide insights into customer satisfaction, spending habits, and overall engagement with the e-commerce platform.
Dataset: It is taken from Kaggle
Platform: Jupyter Notebook

Objectives
1. Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, membership type, and satisfaction levels.
2. Satisfaction Analysis: Analyze the factors influencing customer satisfaction and identify patterns related to different satisfaction levels.
3. Spending Patterns: Investigate spending patterns across different age groups, genders, and cities.
4. Impact of Discounts: Evaluate the effect of discounts on customer spending and satisfaction.
5. Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast customer satisfaction and spending based on historical data.

Insights:
1) Marketing strategies can be tailored for each cluster. Promotions and products can be targeted based on the age and spending behavior of each segment. Special offers or loyalty programs might be more effective if designed according to the spending patterns observed in these clusters.

2) Marketing strategies can be tailored based on gender-specific spending habits. Understanding the factors driving higher spending among male customers can help in developing strategies to increase spend among female customers as well. It may also be useful to explore the types of products purchased by each gender to better tailor marketing and product offerings.

3) The effectiveness of discount strategies should be evaluated. If the goal is to increase total spend, the current discount strategy need revision. Understanding customer behavior in relation to discounts can help in designing more effective promotions. Further analysis might be needed to understand the underlying reasons why customers with no discounts spend more, and whether these customers represent a particular segment with higher purchasing power or different shopping habits.

4) The current discount strategy may not be significantly increasing the number of items purchased by customers. It might be useful to explore different types of promotions or discounts that could better incentivize increased purchases.

5) Gold members are highly satisfied, it's important to maintain or further enhance the benefits and services provided to them to retain their satisfaction.
